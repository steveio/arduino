/**
 * Low Power Mode Sleep Test
 *  
 * Sketch to measure current consumption in various operating modes. 
 * 
 * Compare Low Power Libary ( https://github.com/rocketscream/Low-Power ) 
 * with manual sleep WDT interrupt wake 
 * 
 * Multimeter current readings are influenced by 
 *  - power source 2x 3.7v Li-ion batteries in parrallel with a 5v Boost Converter
 *  - (Boost converter appears to draw current even when Arduino is sleeping)
 *  - 433mhz RF Receiver attached to Arduino 
 *
